                 <h1>HTML Tutorial: Installing VS Code & Live Server | Web Development Tutorials #1</h1>

                <p>In this tutorial, we are going to start our first HTML tutorial. We will now learn about how to write
                    HTML code in the Visual Studio Code.</p>

                <p> It is a free open source IDE from Microsoft which makes our work a lot easier. Therefore, I
                    recommend everyone to download this software and install it. Make a folder named “Complete Web
                    development Bootcamp” and then open VS Code in that folder by pressing right-click > Open with code.
                    In case, you can’t find the option of opening the particular folder with Visual Studio, you can
                    restart your PC or laptop to make sure that changes have taken place after you installed VS Code.
                </p>

                <p>“aaryan.html” is an example of a very simple HTML file in which we make further changes to make it
                    look professional. Although you can write all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes in Notepad, I’ll
                    not recommend doing so. This is because in Notepad you have to make different files and edit them
                    one by one and also it does not provide the option of syntax highlighting. And, I would recommend
                    using the Chrome Browser due to its nice functionality and amazing dev tools. </p>

                <p> Although this tutorial is not a comprehensive explanation of the VS Code, I want you to know some of
                    its basic functionalities. As soon as you enter the exclamation mark (!) in the editor, it gives you
                    the option of Emet Abbreviation. When you click on it, you get a boilerplate sample of the basic
                    HTML format which you can edit further to make a professional website. </p>



                <p>If you are using the Visual Studio Code for the first time, it may look a little complicated to you.
                    But as you keep practicing on it, believe me, it will make your work effortless and easy. Also, if
                    you are going to write codes of Python or any other language in the future, the VS code IDE will
                    definitely be going to help you. You will find five main2 buttons on the left panel of the VS Code.
                    These are Explorer, Search, Git, Debugger, and Extensions. </p>

                <p>One of the most important extensions that I would recommend to install is Live Server. After
                    installing it, refresh the Visual Studio Code and click on the Go Live option in the right bottom.
                    The advantage we get by using this extension is that it automatically makes changes in the web page
                    whatever you write in the HTML code.</p>

                <p>There are two types of settings options in the Visual Studio Code. The first set of settings is the
                    user settings which are used to manage the user and whole VS code. The second set is the Workspace
                    settings which is for only the particular workspace (opened folder) in which you are currently
                    working. You can also change the keyboard shortcuts according to your needs to make your work
                    efficient.</p>

                <p>So these are some basic knowledge and tips about the Visual Studio Code. I hope you have understood
                    all the concepts very easily. The software works the same in macOS and Linux. </p>

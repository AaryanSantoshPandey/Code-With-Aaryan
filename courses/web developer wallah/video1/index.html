                </h1>
                <div class="cont font-karla text-lg">
                    <p>I started this course as an attempt to teach you web development in a fun, easy way! The aim of
                        this course is to teach you how to build a high-quality, responsive, and modern website using
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this course, you will learn about all the technologies involved in web development. All the
                        videos will be uploaded on my YouTube channel “CodeWithHarry” under the playlist section, which
                        you can access from the video description on YouTube. This course is going to benefit all those
                        students who do not know anything and are new to this field. You will get complete knowledge of
                        <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. You will get full information from scratch about web
                        development. Also, those who already have some knowledge can go through the course to learn even
                        further as there are a lot of advanced websites that we will look into by the end of this
                        course.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Now let us first understand what HTML, CSS, and Javascript are for? For every website to be
                        designed, HTML (<strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>) is a must. This is the skeleton of a
                        website. Without it, no website can run. CSS (<strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>) adds
                        beauty to that website and JavaScript adds the brain to allow the functioning of that website.
                        Therefore, CSS and JavaScript add beauty and brain to a particular website respectively.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>Let us now take another example of a car. The HTML acts as the metallic body of a car and the CSS
                        acts as the color and design of the car. Finally, the engine of a car is like the JavaScript on
                        the website to add functionality.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Normally, a client or a user sends a request to the webserver of the website, he wants to visit.
                        The web server that has its own IP address stores all the files in the backend which can be
                        written in PHP, Python, or Node.js. The web server sends a response to the client in the form of
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Finally, to understand-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>HTML</strong> is used as a standard language for any website design. It acts as a
                            static skeleton to a web application. It’s a well-standardized system.</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS </strong>is used to handle the presentation of the web page. It makes the
                            website look attractive and beautiful.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript </strong>allows scripting on your website and makes it completely dynamic
                            in nature. It provides front end scripting for your website and is a high-level dynamic
                            interpreted programming language.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have a lot of concepts in them which we will take over through the
                        span of this course. Therefore, it cannot be learned all at once. If you are a beginner,
                        learning <strong>HTML up to 80%</strong>, <strong>CSS up to 40-60%</strong>, and<strong>
                            JavaScript up to 50-70%</strong> will be more than enough to start building websites. This
                        is something nobody in the web development industry talks about and hence I thought to share
                        this personal advice with all of you.&nbsp; Please don't get me wrong when I say that. Once you
                        have learned and understood the bare minimum to build a website you can come back to the course
                        and start watching it once again for perfecting and sharpening the already learned concepts.
                        Sometimes following this practice gets difficult, the good news is that once you start watching
                        these videos and get your hands dirty with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the rest you will
                        gradually learn based upon your practices and experiences with the help of projects I have
                        designed as a part of this course. You need to learn all the concepts simultaneously and
                        co-relate all the things by practicing them.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>So this was the introductory part where we have learned the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript. By following the course, you will learn some advanced concepts and build your
                        website. Therefore, go through the course and start your journey to become a better web
                        developer.</p>

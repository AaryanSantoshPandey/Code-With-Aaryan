                    <h1>[Updated 2022] Best Laptops To Buy in 2022 - Laptop Buying Guide between 40-70k INR</h1>

                    <p>Hey peeps, it’s time to get back to the college in an offline mode and I hope that you all are
                        excited and preparing yourself for it.</p>

                    <p>After going through the comments of my videos, I found there are several students who have not
                        purchased a laptop and they’re in search of a good laptop, but confused, because there are tons
                        of
                        options available. Don’t worry I got you covered!</p>

                    <p>In this post, we’ll be discussing top laptops for the people whose budget is around 40-70k.
                        There are certain points that I want to make very clear,</p>

                    <p> <strong>Firstly</strong> all the laptops contain RTX 3000 series GPU because this is the latest
                        GPU
                        and it has some mind-boggling features such as DLSS, Reflex, etc., and this series is based on
                        Ampere Architecture.</p>

                    <h2>1. HP Pavilion Ryzen 5600H, GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop:</h2>
                    <img src="/img/hp lapotp.png" alt="" class="laptop">

                    <p>This is the laptop that has driven me crazy because after looking at the specs and the price I
                        was
                        totally amazed. This laptop comes with Ryzen 5 5600H processor that contains 6 cores, and 12
                        threads. It has RTX 3050 in it and on top of that, you’ll fall in love with the design of this
                        laptop because it looks really premium and classy laptop.</p>

                    <h2>2: ASUS TUF A15 (2021) Gaming, Business (AMD Ryzen 7 4800H) Laptop:

                    <p>This laptop is a true beast guys, it comes with an octa-core processor. Though the gen is 4th and
                        not
                        the latest one, still it defeats most of the 5th gen processors, if you want my simple answer
                        then
                        yes it is better than Ryzen 5 5600H processor. If these generations don’t matter to you, then
                        you
                        can buy this laptop without thinking twice.</p>

                    <p>It comes with Ryzen 7 4800H (8 cores and 16 threads) processor. And it has a 144Hz 15.6-inch
                        display.
                        It has an 8GB Ram pre-installed on it, but you can upgrade the RAM to 32 Gigabytes according to
                        your
                        needs. And it has RTX 3050 GPU with 4GB VRAM.</p>

                        <li>Ram upgradeable up to 32GB</li>
                        <li>Great upgradability options</li>
